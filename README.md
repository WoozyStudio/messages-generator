# Messages Generator

In this project you will find a discord bot code to generate messages of all kinds:

- Timestamp
- Markdown
- Embeds
- Normal Messages
- Buttons

To start with the bot configuration is very easy. First you will create a folder called `config`. **IMPORTANT: This folder has to be outside the src folder, otherwise it will give an error.**
Then inside that folder create a file called config.json with this code inside:

```json
{    
    "token": "",
    "botId": ""
}
```

To start the bot you must type in the terminal: `node .`

These are the dependencies that you must install with `npm i <dependency>`:

Example: `npm i discord.js`

```
@discordjs/rest
discord-api-types
discord.js
```
